Welcome to my blog series on neural networks, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"][zero2hero-series] video series. This blog aims to provide engaging notes and exercises that complement Karpathy's insightful tutorials.

We'll begin by diving into the [first video][mgrad-video] of the series, which I've broken down into three distinct blog posts for easier digestion:

1. **Demystifying Backpropagation**: In this post, we'll begin with some notes giving an overview of mircograd and then explore the fundamental concept of backpropagation, the backbone of neural network training.

2. **Hands-on Backpropagation**: Here, we'll implement a backpropagation algorithm for a simple neural network, giving you practical experience with this crucial technique.

3. **From Micrograd to PyTorch**: In our final installment, we'll demonstrate how to transition from implementing a neural network using Micrograd to leveraging the power of PyTorch, a popular deep learning framework.

Join me on this exciting journey as we unravel the intricacies of neural networks, from foundational concepts to practical implementations!
