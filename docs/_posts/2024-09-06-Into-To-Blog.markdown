Welcome to my blog series on neural networks, inspired by Andrej Karpathy's ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"][zero2hero-series] video series. This blog aims to provide engaging notes and exercises that complement Karpathy's tutorials.

My first set of posts will be on the [first video][mgrad-video] of the series. I will split the video into three different blog posts:

1. **On Backpropagation (Basics of Differentiation)**: In this post, we'll begin with some notes giving an overview of mircograd and then explore the fundamental concept of backpropagation, the backbone of neural network training.

2. **On Backpropagation (Applying to Neural Networks)**: Here, we'll implement a backpropagation algorithm for a simple neural network.

3. **From Micrograd to PyTorch**: Micrograd was designed to have similar syntax to Pytorch. In my final post in this series I will go through how to convert some Micrograd code into Pytorch, and highlight any differences.
