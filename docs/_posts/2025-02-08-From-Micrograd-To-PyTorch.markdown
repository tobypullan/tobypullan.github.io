## Introduction

doing the same thing but in PyTorch: comparison
01:43:55 building out a neural net library (multi-layer perceptron) in micrograd
01:51:04 creating a tiny dataset, writing the loss function
01:57:56 collecting all of the parameters of the neural net
02:01:12 doing gradient descent optimization manually, training the network
02:14:03 summary of what we learned, how to go towards modern neural nets
02:16:46 walkthrough of the full code of micrograd on github
02:21:10 real stuff: diving into PyTorch, finding their backward pass for tanh
02:24:39 conclusion
02:25:20 outtakes :)
