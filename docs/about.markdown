Hello! My name is Toby and I am a second year computer science student at Durham University. I am interested in machine learning which is what this blog will largely be focused on. So far I have written two posts focusing on backpropagation using Andrej Karpathy's ["Neural Networks: Zero to Hero"][zero2hero-series] series. Going forward I want to write some essays talking about the future of artificial intelligence and about some of my own projects.
